1. Create an app that includes the following components:
    - A circular profile picture displayed at the top of the screen.
    - A centered title positioned just below the profile picture.
    - A description located below the title, also centered.
    - A 3x3 image listView positioned below the description.

2. Implement a responsive design:
    - When the device is rotated, the profile picture should move to the right side of the screen.
    - The rest of the content should appear on the right side.

3. Fetch images from a network source:
    - Make use of Flutter's network image loading capabilities to display the images in the 3x3 image listView.
