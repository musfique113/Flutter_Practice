### **Questions**
- Create a Flutter app with a Scaffold as the root widget.
- Implement an AppBar at the top with a title "Photo Gallery".
- Inside the body of the Scaffold, create a SingleChildScrollView to enable scrolling.
- Within the SingleChildScrollView, create a Column widget.
- Inside the Column widget, add a Container to display a welcome message such as "Welcome to My Photo Gallery!".
- Below the welcome message, create a TextField for users to search for specific photos. Use appropriate styling and placeholder text. No search functionality needed, just design the TextField.
- Implement a Wrap widget to display a grid of photos.
- The images must be Network Images. You can choose any network image as you like. There must be at least 6 images in the Wrap Widget.
- Each photo should be represented by an ElevatedButton or OutlineButton with an Image and caption below it.
- While clicking on each image, there should be a Snackbar showing the message "Clicked on photo!".
- Add appropriate spacing and styling to the buttons, images, and captions.
- Use a ListView to display a list of ListTile widgets below the photo grid.
- Each ListTile should represent a photo with a title and a subtitle. Add at least three sample photos to the list.
- Implement a button, such as an IconButton, that when pressed, displays a SnackBar with the message "Photos Uploaded Successfully!"
