<summary>Question</summary>

- Create a screen to display a list of contacts.
- The contact list should be populated with at least three contacts, including their names, email addresses, and phone numbers.
- Each contact in the list should be represented as a ListTile widget.
- Implement a tap gesture on each ListTile so that when a contact is tapped, a bottom sheet appears.
- The bottom sheet should display the contact's details, including their name, email address, and phone number.
- Ensure that the contact details are dynamically fetched from the tapped contact.
- The bottom sheet should be dismissed when the user interacts with it.
